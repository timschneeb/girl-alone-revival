# Native code analysis

This folder contains some tools and patch files to facilitate reverse-engineering the native code.

Please note that the native patches have been moved to /patches in the repository root. The .bps files in the `old-patch-scripts` subdirectory may not be up-to-date and are stored here for historical reasons.
