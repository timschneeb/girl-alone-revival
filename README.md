Girl Alone is a discontinued simulation game originally created by fleximindg that was suddenly shut down in 2023. Despite being a single-player game, it integrates heavily with the official servers for anti-cheat reasons. Each user's entire save data was stored on the server, and each action was verified by the server to prevent cheating.

This custom server implementation serves as a replacement for the official servers, allowing you to continue playing the game on Android. Server-sided anti-cheat measures have been removed, and the game has been patched to connect to this server instead of the official servers. Please note that all shop items obtainable via in-app purchases have their prices blanked out and cannot be used. Similarly, ads and ad rewards have been removed.
